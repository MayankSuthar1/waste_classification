## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

**Problem:** "Unable to access camera" error

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Browser Permissions**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Camera → Allow for your site
   - Firefox: Settings → Permissions → Camera → Allow
   - Safari: Preferences → Websites → Camera → Allow

2. **HTTPS Required**
   - Camera access requires HTTPS (secure connection)
   - On localhost, HTTP works for testing
   - For production, use HTTPS/SSL certificate

3. **Camera in Use**
   - Close other apps using the camera
   - Restart the browser
   - Check camera is physically connected (webcam)

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Update to latest browser version
   - Try a different browser
   - Check MediaDevices API support

### Photo Quality Issues

**Problem:** Blurry or dark photos

**Solutions:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Hold camera steady when capturing
- Clean camera lens
- Adjust camera positioning

**Problem:** Wrong camera on mobile

**Solution:**
- The app automatically uses back camera (`facingMode: 'environment'`)
- If front camera opens, check browser settings
- Some browsers may default to front camera

## 💻 For Developers

### Code Integration

The camera feature is implemented using:

1. **HTML5 MediaDevices API**
   ```javascript
   navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: {...} })
   ```

2. **Canvas API** for capture
   ```javascript
   canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(video, 0, 0)
   ```

3. **Blob API** for file creation
   ```javascript
   canvas.toBlob((blob) => {...}, 'image/jpeg', 0.95)
   ```

### Key Functions

```javascript
openCamera()      // Initialize camera stream
closeCamera()     // Stop camera and close modal
capturePhoto()    // Capture frame and process
```

### Customization Options

**Change Camera Resolution:**
```javascript
video: {
    width: { ideal: 1920 },   // Full HD
    height: { ideal: 1080 }
}
```

**Use Front Camera:**
```javascript
facingMode: 'user'  // Instead of 'environment'
```

**Adjust Image Quality:**
```javascript
canvas.toBlob((blob) => {...}, 'image/jpeg', 0.80)  // 80% quality
```

### Adding Camera to Other Pages

Copy the camera modal HTML and JavaScript from `templates/index.html`:
- Camera modal div
- Video and canvas elements
- Camera control functions
- CSS styles

## 📱 Mobile Best Practices

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Lighting**
   - Use natural or bright artificial light
   - Avoid shadows on the waste item
   - Don't photograph against bright windows

2. **Positioning**
   - Fill the frame with the waste item
   - Hold camera parallel to item (not angled)
   - Ensure item is in focus before capturing

3. **Background**
   - Use simple, contrasting backgrounds
   - Avoid cluttered backgrounds
   - Plain surfaces work best

4. **Distance**
   - Not too close (may blur)
   - Not too far (details get lost)
   - 20-40cm distance is ideal

## 🔄 Workflow

### Complete Camera Capture Flow:

1. User clicks "Take Photo with Camera"
2. Browser requests camera permission
3. User grants permission
4. Camera stream starts
5. Live preview shows in modal
6. User positions waste item
7. User clicks "Capture Photo"
8. Canvas captures current frame
9. Image converted to JPEG blob
10. Camera stream stops
11. Modal closes
12. Image preview shows
13. Image uploaded to server
14. AI model classifies waste
15. Results displayed with confidence scores

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### HTTPS Setup (Required)

For production with camera feature:

1. **Get SSL Certificate**
   - Let's Encrypt (free)
   - CloudFlare (free tier)
   - Purchase from certificate authority

2. **Configure Flask for HTTPS**
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')  # For testing
       # OR use proper certificates:
       app.run(ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))
   ```

3. **Use Reverse Proxy**
   - Nginx with SSL
   - Apache with SSL
   - Cloud platform (handles SSL automatically)

### Performance Optimization

**For High Traffic:**
- Compress images before upload
- Add image size validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Use CDN for static assets

**For Mobile:**
- Optimize modal for small screens
- Add loading indicators
- Handle orientation changes
- Test on various devices
